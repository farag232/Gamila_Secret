        <p>
        Jamila was born into a Druze family in the Galilee village of Paki'in. From the dawn of her childhood, she accompanied her grandparents and mother when they went out to collect medicinal plants on the slopes of the mountains, and in the fields of the Galilee, which are rich in plants. Jamila's grandparents were a kind of alternative doctors in the years when there was no doctor in Peke'in, and they healed people with the help of plants.

The connection between Jamila and nature was so strong that pushed her when she grew up to try to explore the secrets of the vast fields rich in vegetation, which she calls "nature's pharmacy". For decades she developed an original and powerful formula of plants and oils from nature in her home. Jamila's original formula is used as a base for all Jamila Secret products.

Jamila's secret formula!
Nature's anti-aging!

Jamila's wild plant formula is 100% natural, and is the result of many years of experiments based on centuries-old traditional knowledge, along with an in-depth knowledge of the country's medicinal plants.
